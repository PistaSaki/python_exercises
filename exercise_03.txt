PART1: Structure of a python project.

There are more conventions. I will describe mine and your task will be to refactor your homework repository to follow this structure.

homework02
├───homework02
    ├───ex01
    └───ex02
   
Make sure that all your folders are python packages -- that is, they contain `__init__.py`. 

PART2: testing
I use pytest library. Read few words online https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/index.html
and then look at my repository http://git.tipsport.it/users/stefan.sakalos/repos/homework02
I have put all the test files into the `test` folder and I follow the same package structure as in the main package `homework02`. (Actually there is only one test file "Dhomework02\test\ex01\module_01_test.py")

homework02
├───homework02
│   ├───ex01
│   └───ex02
├───test
      ├───ex01
      └───ex02

Now add tests into your own repository following the same structure.  

PART3: Requirements file
In our project so far we have used only one external library: pytest. It is a good practice to keep track of all the external libraries in requirements.txt.
Look at requirements.txt in my repository and create a similar file in your own project.

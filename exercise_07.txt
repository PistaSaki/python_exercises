Read about context-managers for instance here:
https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/context_managers.html
You can skip the last part: 26.3. Implementing a Context Manager as a Generator

Implement a context-manager `saved_list` that creates an empty list when entering a with-block and automatically saves the content of that list into a json file when exiting the with-block.
This is a test for that behavior:
```
path = Path("d:/tmp.json")

with saved_list(path) as my_list:
    assert my_list == []
    my_list.append(1)
    my_list.append(2)

with open(path, "rt") as f:
    assert json.load(f) == [1, 2]
```
Please implement the `saved_list` first as a class. 
If you feel like it, implement in again using `contextlib.contextmanager` decorator and a generator as described in https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/context_managers.html#implementing-a-context-manager-as-a-generator

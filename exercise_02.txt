a) Write a class “Bucket” with following fields: volume, temperature.

b) redefine “__str__” method of Bucket so that if I call “print(b)” I get output “Bucket with volume 10l and temperature 25 C.”

c) Redefine addition in this class so that you can write b3 = b1 + b2 and that corresponds to adding the two buckets of water together.

d) Read about properties in python for instance here https://www.python-course.eu/python3_tests.php. Then implement the following behaviour: 
  i) b.enery will the energy in Joules needed to warm the bucket of volume b.volume to the temperature b.temperature starting from zero C. (Disregard the phase changes solid -> liquid-> gas).

  ii) code “b.energy = 10” will set the temperature so that “b.energy == 10”

e) add method “write_json(path)” that writes bucket to json file.

f) add class-method “Bucket.load_json(path)” that reads a json file and returns a Bucket instance

g) define child class “Cup” that overrides the __str__ method of Bucket

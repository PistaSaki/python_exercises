Iterables, Iterators and Generators

Read something to understand the above. For instance:
https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-iterator-tutorial

1. To `Bucket` class from exercise 02 add a generator metod `sub_buckets` that iterates through sub-buckets of specified size. That is, the following code:
```
bucket =  Bucket(volume=7.5, temperature=10)

for sub_bucket in bucket.sub_buckets(size=2):
   print(sub_bucket)```

prints the following
```
Bucket with volume 2 l and temperature 10 C.
Bucket with volume 2 l and temperature 10 C.
Bucket with volume 2 l and temperature 10 C.
Bucket with volume 1.5 l and temperature 10 C.
```

2. Turn `Bucket` into an iterable. Iterating through it yields sub-buckets of size 1 liter. 
Hint: use the `sub_buckets` method.

The test script:
```
for i, sub_bucket in enumerate(bucket):
   print(i, sub_bucket)
```
now prints:
```
0 Bucket with volume 1 l and temperature 10 C.
1 Bucket with volume 1 l and temperature 10 C.
2 Bucket with volume 1 l and temperature 10 C.
3 Bucket with volume 1 l and temperature 10 C.
4 Bucket with volume 1 l and temperature 10 C.
5 Bucket with volume 1 l and temperature 10 C.
6 Bucket with volume 1 l and temperature 10 C.
7 Bucket with volume 0.5 l and temperature 10 C.
```
